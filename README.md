# NYC Schools Coding Challenge
## Introduction
This is a take home coding challenge for an iOS position.

### Requirements
The challenge is to create an iOS app that lists NYC schools and displays extra information about a school when selected. The specifications (shortened) are:
> 1. Display a list of NYC high schools.
> 2. Selecting a school should show additional information (at the least, include SAT scores).

Data is from NYC Open Data: [school directory](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2), [SAT results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4).

### Screenshots

## Implementation
For the implementation, I used Swift + Storyboards. Relevant code are in 2 files ([SchoolsListViewController](/20230227-BH-NYCSchools/SchoolsListViewController.swift), [SchoolInformationViewController](/20230227-BH-NYCSchools/SchoolInformationViewController.swift)). Other files are boilerplate generated by XCode. The UI is set up through XCode's Storyboard editor window.
- [SchoolsListViewController](/20230227-BH-NYCSchools/SchoolsListViewController.swift): the entry point of the app, responsible for loading in CSV data and initializing/displaying the list of schools
- [SchoolInformationViewController](/20230227-BH-NYCSchools/SchoolInformationViewController.swift): displays school information that it receives from SchoolsListViewController

### Improvements
Just noting some possible follow-up tasks here:
- Use null checks instead of force-unwrapping data from rows
- Remove hardcoded strings for data column names
- Use more proper UI elements instead of mainly UILabel
  - Example: using UITextView would make the school website link clickable
